# Decision Document: Ensuring Patch Synchronization Across Branches

## Objective
To create a reliable process or GitHub Action to ensure that patches applied to upstream branches (e.g., `master`, `staging`, `qa`) are also present in lower branches. This aims to prevent divergences and maintain consistency across the branch hierarchy.

---

## Approaches

### 1. Validation-Only Approach  
- **What It Does:**  
  Validates if the lower branch (e.g., `development`) contains all commits from the upstream branch (e.g., `qa`), but it does not actively synchronize them.
  
- **How It Works:**  
  - Use `git merge-base --is-ancestor` to verify if the upstream branch's latest commit is an ancestor of the lower branch.
  - Optionally use `git diff` to compare the branch states.

- **Implementation Example:**
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/<upstream-branch> HEAD || exit 1
  ```

- **Pros:**
  - Lightweight and efficient for simple branch hierarchies.
  - No risk of unintended merges or changes.
  - Easy to implement with minimal configuration.

- **Cons:**
  - Does not ensure synchronization—it only detects inconsistencies.
  - Merge commits or cherry-picked commits can lead to false negatives/positives.
  - Conflicts are detected but not resolved.

- **Best Use Case:**  
  Teams that prefer to handle patch synchronization manually and want to block PRs that do not include upstream patches.

---

### 2. Full-State Validation with `git diff`  
- **What It Does:**  
  Compares the entire state of the upstream and lower branches to check if they are identical or mergeable.

- **How It Works:**  
  - Fetch the latest upstream branch and compare its state with the lower branch using `git diff --quiet`.

- **Implementation Example:**
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git diff --quiet origin/<upstream-branch> || exit 1
  ```

- **Pros:**
  - Ensures the exact content of upstream commits is reflected in the lower branch.
  - Handles scenarios where merge commits or cherry-picked commits might otherwise pass validation-only checks.

- **Cons:**
  - Slightly more resource-intensive than validation-only.
  - Does not automate synchronization; requires manual intervention for detected differences.

- **Best Use Case:**  
  Teams that want stricter enforcement of patch consistency without automation.

---

### 3. Automatic Synchronization  
- **What It Does:**  
  Automatically merges or pulls changes from the upstream branch into the lower branch, ensuring synchronization.

- **How It Works:**  
  - Use `git merge` or `git pull` to incorporate changes.
  - Handle conflicts manually or with a predefined strategy.

- **Implementation Example:**
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git merge origin/<upstream-branch> || exit 1
  git push origin HEAD
  ```

- **Pros:**
  - Guarantees synchronization across branches.
  - Reduces manual effort for developers.

- **Cons:**
  - Requires robust conflict resolution processes.
  - Risk of overwriting changes in lower branches if not carefully managed.
  - Adds complexity to CI/CD workflows.

- **Best Use Case:**  
  Teams with disciplined workflows and confidence in automated conflict handling.

---

### 4. GitHub Mergeability API Check  
- **What It Does:**  
  Uses GitHub’s Mergeability API to check if the lower branch can merge cleanly with the upstream branch.

- **How It Works:**  
  - Query GitHub’s API to test if the upstream branch is mergeable into the lower branch.

- **Implementation Example:**
  ```bash
  curl -X GET     -H "Authorization: token <YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN>"     "https://api.github.com/repos/<owner>/<repo>/merges?base=<lower-branch>&head=<upstream-branch>"
  ```

- **Pros:**
  - Directly leverages GitHub’s built-in mergeability logic.
  - Integrates seamlessly with GitHub workflows.

- **Cons:**
  - Requires API tokens and network access.
  - Limited flexibility compared to local Git commands.
  - Cannot ensure synchronization, only mergeability.

- **Best Use Case:**  
  Teams with complex branching strategies that frequently rely on GitHub’s PR interface.

## Recommendations

1. **Primary Option: Validation-Only with `merge-base`**
   - Use this approach for simplicity and efficiency if manual synchronization is acceptable.
   - Ideal for teams that want lightweight checks without automating merges.

2. **Enhanced Option: Full-State Validation with `git diff`**
   - Use this approach for stricter enforcement of branch consistency.
   - Ideal for teams that can tolerate slightly higher resource usage for better accuracy.

3. **Advanced Option: Automatic Synchronization**
   - Use this if your team is ready to adopt automated merging and handle potential conflicts proactively.
   - Ideal for teams with mature CI/CD processes and a disciplined branching strategy.

4. **Optional: GitHub Mergeability API**
   - Use this as a complementary tool to validate mergeability for PR workflows, especially in GitHub-native teams.

## Conclusion

For most teams, starting with **validation-only** or **full-state validation** is recommended. As the team and workflow mature, you can consider adopting **automatic synchronization** or integrating the **GitHub Mergeability API** for enhanced automation.
